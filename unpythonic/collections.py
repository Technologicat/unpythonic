def mogrify(func, container):
    """In-place recursive map for mutable containers.

    Recurse on container, apply func to each atom. Containers can be nested,
    with an arbitrary combination of types.

    Containers are detected by checking for instances of ``collections.abc``
    superclasses (also virtuals are ok).

    Supported abcs are ``MutableMapping``, ``MutableSequence``, ``MutableSet``,
    ``Mapping``, ``Sequence`` and ``Set``.

    For convenience, we introduce some special cases:

        - Any classes created by ``collections.namedtuple``, because they
          do not conform to the standard constructor API for a ``Sequence``.

          Thus, for a ``Sequence``, we first check for the presence of a
          ``._make()`` method, and if found, use it as the constructor.
          Otherwise we use the regular constructor.

        - ``str`` is treated as an atom, although technically a ``Sequence``.

          It doesn't conform to the exact same API (its constructor does not take
          an iterable), and often we don't want to mogrify strings inside other
          containers anyway.

          (If you want to process strings, implement it in your ``func``.)

        - The ``box`` container provided by this module; although mutable,
          its update is not conveniently expressible by the abc APIs.

        - The ``cons`` container from ``unpythonic.llist`` (including the
          ``llist`` linked lists). This is treated with the general tree
          strategy. Any ``nil`` is passed through as-is.

    Any value that does not match any of these is treated as an atom.

    Any **mutable** container encountered is updated in-place.

    Any **immutable** container encountered is transformed into a new copy,
    just like in ``map``.

class box:
    """Minimalistic, mutable single-item container Ã  la Racket.

    Motivation::

        x = 17
        def f(x):
            x = 23  # no!
        f(x)
        print(x)  # still 17

    Solution - box it, to keep the actual data in an attribute::

        b = box(17)
        def f(b):
            b << 23  # yes!
        f(b)
        print(unbox(b))  # 23

    This is the recommended unpythonic syntax. If you like OOP, you can
    `b.set(23)` instead of `b << 23`, and `b.get()` instead of `unbox(b)`.

    In terms of ``collections.abc``, a ``box`` is a ``Container``, ``Iterable``
    and ``Sized``. A box is **not** hashable, because it is a mutable container.

    Additionally, ``box`` supports equality testing with ``==`` and ``!=``.
    A box is considered equal to the item it contains, and two boxes with
    items that compare equal are considered equal.

    Iterating over the box returns the item and then stops iteration.

    The length of a ``box`` is always 1; even if ``x is None``, the box still
    has the empty slot. (Or in other words, ``None`` in a box is just a data
    value like any other.)

    **Disclaimer**: maybe silly. The standard pythonic solutions are to box
    with a ``list`` (then trying to remember it represents a box, not a list),
    or use the ``nonlocal`` or ``global`` statements if lexically appropriate
    for the particular situation. This class just makes the programmer's intent
    more explicit.

    Hold a target object inside a box. When an attribute of the shim
    is accessed (whether to get or set it), redirect that access to
    the object that is currently inside the box.

    The target may be replaced at any time, simply by sending a new value
    into the box instance you gave to the `Shim` constructor.

    Another use case is to combo with `ThreadLocalBox`, e.g. to redirect
    stdin/stdout only when used from some specific threads.

    Since deep down, attribute access is the whole point of objects, `Shim` is
    essentially a transparent object proxy. (For example, a method call is an
    attribute read (via a descriptor), followed by a function call.)

    thebox:   a `box` instance that holds the target object. The box must
              be created manually, to maximize composability: a `box` or
              `ThreadLocalBox` can be chosen as appropriate for the
              particular use case.

    fallback: optional; a fallback object. Either any object (not boxed),
              or a `box` instance (in case you want to replace the fallback
              later).

              **For attribute reads** (i.e. `__getattr__`), if the object in
              the box does not have the requested attribute, `Shim` will try
              to get it from the fallback. If `fallback` is boxed, the
              attribute read takes place on the object in the box. If it is
              not boxed, the attribute read takes place directly on `fallback`.

              Any **attribute writes** (i.e. `__setattr__`, binding or rebinding
              an attribute) always take place on the primary target object
              in `thebox`.

    If you need to chain fallbacks, this can be done with `foldr`::

        boxes = [box(obj) for obj in ...]
        *others, final_fallback = boxes
        s = foldr(Shim, final_fallback, others)

    Supports slicing (also recursively, i.e. can be sliced again).

    We store slice specs, not actual indices, so this works also if the
    underlying sequence undergoes length changes.

    **Not** hashable, since the whole point is a live view to input that
    may change at any time. However, as usual, iteration assumes that
    no inserts/deletes in the underlying sequence occur during iteration.
    (So be careful with threads.)

    The read-only cousin of ``view``. For usage examples, see ``view``; this
    behaves the same except no ``__setitem__`` or ``reverse``.

    **Notes**

    In terms of ABCs, this is an ``unpythonic.collections.SequenceView``.

    Slicing an ``roview`` or a ``view`` returns a new ``roview``. Slicing
    anything else will usually copy, because the object being sliced does,
    before we get control.

    To slice lazily, first view the sequence itself and then slice that.
    The initial no-op view is optimized away, so it won't slow down accesses.
    Alternatively, pass a ``slice`` object into the view constructor.

    The view can be efficiently iterated over.

    Getting/setting an item (subscripting) checks whether the index cache needs
    updating during each access, so it can be a bit slow. Setting a slice checks
    just once, and then updates the underlying iterable directly.

    Core idea based on StackOverflow answer by Mathieu Caroff (2018):
