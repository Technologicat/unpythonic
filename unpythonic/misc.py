def call(thunk):
    """Decorator: run immediately, overwrite function by its return value.

    Can be used to make lispy not-quite-functions where the def just delimits
    a block of code that runs immediately (think call-with-something in Lisps).

    The function will be called with zero arguments.

    Name inspired by "call-with-something", but since here we're calling
    without any arguments, it's just "call".

    Examples::

        @call
        def result():  # this block of code runs immediately
            return "hello"
        print(result)  # "hello"

        @call
        def _():
            ...  # code with cheeky side effects goes here

        @call
        def x():
            a = 2  #    many temporaries that help readability...
            b = 3  # ...of this calculation, but would just pollute locals...
            c = 5  # ...after the block exits
            return a * b * c

                    ...

def pack(*args):
    """Multi-argument constructor for tuples.

    In other words, the inverse of tuple unpacking, as a function.

    E.g. `pack(a, b, c)` is the same as `(a, b, c)`.

    We provide this because the default constructor `tuple(...)` requires an
    iterable, and there are use cases (especially in Python 3.4, before PEP 448)
    where it is useful to be able to say *pack these args into a tuple*.

    See:
        https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/

    Examples. If args naturally come in separately::

        myzip = lambda lol: map(pack, *lol)
        lol = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
        for z in myzip(lol):
