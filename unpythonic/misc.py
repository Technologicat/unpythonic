    """Multi-argument constructor for tuples.

    In other words, the inverse of tuple unpacking, as a function.
    E.g. ``pack(a, b, c)`` is the same as ``(a, b, c)``.

    We provide this because the default constructor `tuple(...)` requires an
    iterable, and there are use cases where it is useful to be able to say
    *pack these args into a tuple*.

    See also:
        https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0448/

    Examples. If args naturally arrive separately::

        myzip = lambda lol: map(pack, *lol)
        lol = ((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))
        for z in myzip(lol):

            return loop(acc + pack(f"{numb:d}{lett}"))

def namelambda(name):
    """Rename a function. Decorator.

    This can be used to give a lambda a meaningful name, which is especially
    useful for debugging in cases where a lambda is returned as a closure,
    and the actual call into it occurs much later (so that if the call crashes,
    the stack trace will report a meaningful name, not just ``"<lambda>"``).

    To support reordering by ``unpythonic.syntax.util.sort_lambda_decorators``,
    this is a standard parametric decorator, called like::

        foo = namelambda("foo")(lambda ...: ...)

    The first call returns a *foo-renamer*, and supplying the lambda to that
    actually returns a lambda that has the name *foo*.

    This is used internally by some macros (``namedlambda``, ``let``, ``do``),
    but also provided as part of unpythonic's public API in case it's useful
    elsewhere.

    **CAUTION**: When a function definition is executed, the names the parent
    scopes had at that time are baked into the function's ``__qualname__``.
    Hence renaming a function after it is defined will not affect the
    dotted names of any closures defined *inside* that function.

    This is mainly an issue for nested lambdas::

        from unpythonic import namelambda, withself
        nested = namelambda("outer")(lambda: namelambda("inner")(withself(lambda self: self)))
        print(nested.__qualname__)    # "outer"
        print(nested().__qualname__)  # "<lambda>.<locals>.inner"

    Note the inner lambda does not see the outer's new name.
