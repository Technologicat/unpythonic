"""Mathematical sequences.

We provide a compact syntax to create lazy constant, arithmetic, geometric and
power. Numeric (int, float, mpmath) and symbolic (SymPy) formats are supported.
We avoid accumulating roundoff error when used with floating-point.

We also provide arithmetic operation support for iterables (termwise).

The function versions of the arithmetic operations have an **s** prefix (short
for mathematical **sequence**), because in Python the **i** prefix (which could
stand for *iterable*) is already used to denote the in-place operators.

We provide the Cauchy product, and its generalization, the diagonal
combination-reduction, for two (possibly infinite) iterables.

Finally, we provide ready-made generators that yield some common sequences
(currently, the Fibonacci numbers and the prime numbers).

def s(*spec):
    """Create a lazy mathematical sequence.

    The sequence is returned as a generator object that supports infix math
    (see ``m``).

    **Formats**

    Below, any ellipsis ``...`` inside an ``s()`` is meant literally.

    The sequence specification may have an optional final element, which must
    belong to the sequence being described. If a final element is specified,
    a finite sequence is returned, terminating after the given final element.

    *Convenience fallback*:

    As a fallback, we accept an explicit enumeration of all elements of the
    desired sequence. This returns a genexpr that reads from a tuple, but
    adds infix math support. Syntax::

        s(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

    This mainly exists so that the ``...``, if any, can be quickly dropped
    when testing/debugging the user program.

    *Constant sequence*: ``[a0, identity] -> a0, a0, a0, ...``

    Syntax::

        s(1, ...)

    Constant sequences **do not** support the optional-final-element termination
    syntax, because the number of terms cannot be computed from the value of the
    final element.

    *Cyclic sequence*:

    Convenience feature. Tag the repeating cycle of elements with a list
    (must be a list, not a tuple). The list must have at least one element.
    A final ``...``, after the list, is mandatory. Syntax::

        s([*repeats], ...)
        s(*initials, [*repeats], ...)

    Examples::

        s([1, 2], ...)        # --> 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
        s(1, 2, [3, 4], ...)  # --> 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, ... (3, 4 repeat)

    Cyclic sequences **do not** support the optional-final-element termination
    syntax.

    *Arithmetic sequence*: ``[a0, +d] -> a0, a0 + d, a0 + 2 d, ...``

    Two terms required, more allowed if consistent. Syntax::

        s(1, 2, ...)
        s(1, 2, 3, ...)
        s(1, 2, 3, ..., 10)

    *Geometric sequence*: ``[a0, *r] -> a0, a0*r, a0*r**2, ...``

    Three terms required, more allowed if consistent. Syntax::

        s(1, 2, 4, ...)
        s(1, -2, 4, ...)  # alternating geometric sequence
        s(1, 2, 4, ..., 512)
        s(1, -2, 4, ..., -512)
        s(1, 1/2, 1/4, ...)
        s(1, -1/2, 1/4, ...)
        s(1, 1/2, 1/4, ..., 1/512)
        s(1, -1/2, 1/4, ..., -1/512)

    Specified as ``s(a0, a1, a2, ...)``, it must hold that ``a0, a1, a2 != 0``.

    The sequence ``a0, a0**2, a0**3, ...`` is just a special case of a geometric
    sequence, with ``r = a0``, so e.g. ``s(3, 9, 27, ...)`` works as expected.

    *Power sequence*: ``[a0, **p] -> a0, a0**p, a0**(p**2), ...``

    Three terms required, more allowed if consistent. Syntax::

        s(2, 4, 16, ...)
        s(2, 2**2, 2**4, ...)  # equivalent
        s(2, 2**(1/2), 2**(1/4), ...)

    Specified as ``s(a0, a1, a2, ...)``, it must hold that ``|a0| != 1`` and
    ``a1, a2 != 0``.

    If ``spec`` matches none of the above, ``SyntaxError`` is raised at runtime.

    **Symbolic input**

    We support symbolic (SymPy) input for any of the formats::

        from sympy import symbols
        x0 = symbols("x0", real=True)
        k = symbols("x0", positive=True)

        s(x0, ...)
        s(x0, x0 + k, ...)
        s(x0, x0 + k, ..., x0 + 5*k)
        s(x0, x0*k, x0*k**2, ...)
        s(x0, -x0*k, x0*k**2, ...)
        s(x0, x0*k, x0*k**2, ..., x0*k**5)
        s(x0, -x0*k, x0*k**2, ..., -x0*k**5)

        x0, k = symbols("x0, k", positive=True)
        s(x0, x0**k, x0**(k**2), ...)
        s(x0, x0**k, x0**(k**2), ..., x0**(k**5))

    For a symbolic geometric sequence with a final term, it is important that
    SymPy can determine the correct sign; hence in this example we have declared
    ``k`` as positive.

    **Composition**

    We support only these four basic kinds of sequences, because many more
    can be built using them as building blocks. For example::

        1, 4, 9, 16, ...:       s(1, 2, ...)**2
        1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, ...:  1 / s(1, 2, ...)

    Sequences returned by ``s()`` support infix math syntax, so the above
    expressions with ``s()`` are valid Python code.

    A symbolic example::

        from sympy import symbols
        x = symbols("x", real=True)
        powers_of_x = lambda: s(1, x, x**2, ...)
        univariate_polynomial = lambda coeffs: coeffs * powers_of_x()
        s1 = univariate_polynomial(s(1, 3, 5, ...))  # 1, 3*x, 5*x**2, ...
        s2 = univariate_polynomial(s(2, 4, 6, ...))  # 2, 4*x, 6*x**2, ...

    In the example, the lambda is needed because the iterable produced
    by `s(...)` is consumable; hence we must instantiate a new copy of
    the powers of x each time `univariate_polynomial` is called.
    We could also use `gmathify(imemoize(...))`:

        powers_of_x = gmathify(imemoize(s(1, x, x**2, ...)))
        univariate_polynomial = lambda coeffs: coeffs * powers_of_x()

    The rest as above.

    **Notes**

    Symbolic input will create a generator that yields SymPy expressions.

    For floating-point input, the created generators avoid accumulating roundoff
    error (unlike e.g. ``itertools.count``). Even for a long but finite arithmetic
    sequence where the start value and the diff are not exactly representable
    by base-2 floats, the final value should be within 1 ULP of the true value.
    This is because once the input has been analyzed, the terms are generated
    from the closed-form formula for the nth term of the sequence that was
    described by the input; nothing is actually accumulated.

    Note this reverse-engineers the given numbers to figure out which case the
    input corresponds to. Although we take some care to avoid roundoff errors
    in this analysis when used with floating-point input, it may sometimes occur
    that roundoff prevents correct detection of the sequence (especially for
    power sequences, since their detection requires taking logarithms).

class imathify:
    """Endow any iterable with infix math support (termwise).

    The original iterable is saved to an attribute, and ``m.__iter__`` redirects
    to it. No caching is performed, so performing a math operation on the m'd
    iterable will still consume the iterable (if it is consumable, for example
    a generator).

    This adds infix math only; to apply a function (e.g. ``sin``) termwise to
    an iterable, use the comprehension syntax or ``map``, as usual.

    The mathematical sequences (Python-technically, iterables) returned by
    ``s()`` are automatically m'd, as is the result of any infix arithmetic
    operation performed on an already m'd iterable.

    **CAUTION**: When an operation meant for general iterables is applied to an
    m'd iterable, the math support vanishes (because the operation returns a
    general iterable, not an m'd one), but can be restored by m'ing again.

    **NOTE**: The function versions of the operations (``sadd`` etc.) work on
    general iterables (so you don't need to ``m`` their inputs), and return
    an m'd iterable. The ``m`` operation is only needed for infix math, to make
    arithmetic-heavy code more readable.

    Examples::

        a = s(1, 3, ...)
        b = s(2, 4, ...)
        c = a + b
        assert isinstance(c, m)  # the result still has math support
        assert tuple(take(5, c)) == (3, 7, 11, 15, 19)  # + was applied termwise

        d = 1 / (a**2 + b**2)
        assert isinstance(d, m)

        e = take(5, c)     # general iterable operation drops math support...
        assert not isinstance(e, m)

        f = imathify(take(5, c))  # ...and it can be restored by m'ing again.
        assert isinstance(f, m)

        g = imathify((1, 2, 3, 4, 5))
        h = imathify((2, 3, 4, 5, 6))
        assert tuple(g + h) == (3, 5, 7, 9, 11)

        ... |         .

    The element ``c[k]`` is formed by reducing over all combinations of
    ``a[i], b[j]`` for which the table entry at ``(i, j)`` is ``k``.

    The Cauchy product is the special case with ``combine=smul, reduce=sum``.

    The output is automatically m'd so that it supports infix arithmetic.

    The operations:

        - ``combine = combine(a, b)`` is a binary operation that accepts
          two iterables, and combines them termwise into a new iterable.

          Roughly speaking, it gets the slices ``a[:(k+1)]`` and ``b[k::-1]``
          as its input iterables. (Roughly speaking, because of caching and
          finite input handling.) The inputs are guaranteed to have the same
          length.

        - ``reduce = reduce(a)`` is a unary operation that accepts one iterable,
          and produces a scalar. The reduction is only invoked if there is
          at least one term to process.

    The computations for ``a[i]`` and ``b[j]`` are triggered only once (ever)
    for each value of ``i`` or ``j``. The values then enter a local cache.

    The computational cost for the term ``c[k]`` is ``O(k)``, because although
    ``a[i]`` and ``b[j]`` are cached, the reduction itself consists of ``k + 1``
    terms that are all formed with new combinations of ``i`` and ``j``. This means
    the total cost of computing the ``n`` first terms of ``c`` is ``O(n**2)``.

    **CAUTION**: The caching works by applying ``imemoize`` to both inputs;
    the usual caveats apply.

    **Finite inputs**

    **When** ``require="any"``, we run with increasing ``k`` as long **any**
    combination appearing inside the above reduction can be formed. When ``k``
    has reached a value for which no combinations can be formed, the generator
    raises ``StopIteration``.

    In terms of the above table, the table is cut by vertical and horizontal lines
    just after the maximum possible ``i`` and ``j``, and only the terms in the
    upper left quadrant contribute to the reduction (since these are the only
    terms that can be formed).

    For example, if both ``a`` and ``b`` have length 2, and we are computing the
    Cauchy product, then the iterable ``c`` will consist of *three* terms:
    ``c[0] = a[0]*b[0]``, ``c[1] = a[0]*b[1] + a[1]*b[0]``, and
    ``c[2] = a[1]*b[1]``.

    **When** ``require="all"``, we run with increasing ``k`` until either end
    of the diagonal falls of the end of the shorter input. (In the case of inputs
    of equal length, both ends fall off simultaneously.) In other words, ``c[k]``
    is formed only if **all** combinations that would contribute to it (in the
    infinite case) can be formed.

    In terms of the above table, the diagonal marked with the value ``k`` is
    considered, and ``c[k]`` is formed only if all its combinations of
    ``a[i], b[j]`` can be formed from the given finite inputs.

    For example, if both ``a`` and ``b`` have length 2, and we are computing the
    Cauchy product, then the iterable ``c`` will consist of *two* terms:
    ``c[0] = a[0]*b[0]``, and ``c[1] = a[0]*b[1] + a[1]*b[0]``. The term ``c[2]``
    is not formed, because the terms ``a[0]*b[2]`` and ``a[2]*b[0]`` (that would
    contribute to it in the infinite case) cannot be formed from length-2 inputs.
