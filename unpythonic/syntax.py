    For a body with multiple expressions, use an extra set of brackets.
    This inserts a ``do``. Only the outermost extra brackets are interpreted
    specially; all others in the bodies are interpreted as usual, as lists.

    Each ``name`` in the same ``let`` must be unique.

    Assignment to let-bound variables is supported with syntax such as ``x << 42``.
    This is an expression, performing the assignment, and returning the new value.

    for local variables that are not part of the ``let``; see ``do`` for details.

    Technical points:

        - In reality, the let-bound variables live in an ``unpythonic.env``.
          This macro performs the magic to make them look (and pretty much behave)
          like lexical variables.

        - Compared to ``unpythonic.lispylet.let``, the macro version needs no quotes
          around variable names in bindings.

        - The body is automatically wrapped in a ``lambda e: ...``.

        - For all ``x`` in bindings, the macro transforms ``x --> e.x``.

        - Lexical scoping is respected (so ``let`` constructs can be nested)
          by actually using a unique name (gensym) instead of just ``e``.

        - In the case of a multiple-expression body, the ``do`` transformation
          is applied first to ``[body0, ...]``, and the result becomes ``body``.

    Return value is the value of the last expression inside the ``do``.

    Usage::

        do[body0, ...]

    Example::

        do[localdef(x << 42),
           print(x),
           x << 23,
           x]

    This is sugar on top of ``unpythonic.seq.do``, but with some extra features.

        - To declare and initialize a local name, use ``localdef(name << value)``.

          The operator ``localdef`` is syntax, not really a function, and it
          only exists inside a ``do``.

        - By design, there is no way to create an uninitialized variable;
          a value must be given at declaration time. Just use ``None``
          as an explicit "no value" if needed.

        - Names declared within the same ``do`` must be unique. Re-declaring
          the same name is an expansion-time error.

        - To assign to an already declared local name, use ``name << value``.

    **localdef declarations**

    All ``localdef`` declarations are collected (and the declaration part
    discarded) before any other processing, so it does not matter where each
    ``localdef`` appears inside the ``do``. Especially, in::

        do[x << 2,
           localdef(x << 3),  # DANGER: may break in a future version
           x]

    already the first ``x`` refers to the local x, because ``x`` **has a**
    ``localdef`` in this ``do``. (This subject to change in a future version.)

    For readability and future-proofness, it is recommended to place localdefs
    at or near the start of the do-block, at the first use of each local name.

    **Syntactic ambiguity**

    These two cases cannot be syntactically distinguished:

        - Just one body expression, which is a literal tuple or list,

        - Multiple body expressions, represented as a literal tuple or list.

    ``do`` always uses the latter interpretation.

    Whenever there are multiple expressions in the body, the ambiguity does not
    arise, because then the distinction between the sequence of expressions itself
    and its items is clear.

    Examples::

        do[1, 2, 3]   # --> tuple, 3
        do[(1, 2, 3)] # --> tuple, 3 (since in Python, the comma creates tuples;
                      #     parentheses are only used for disambiguation)
        do[[1, 2, 3]] # --> list, 3
        do[[[1, 2, 3]]]  # --> list containing a list, [1, 2, 3]
        do[([1, 2, 3],)] # --> tuple containing a list, [1, 2, 3]
        do[[1, 2, 3],]   # --> tuple containing a list, [1, 2, 3]
        do[[(1, 2, 3)]]  # --> list containing a tuple, (1, 2, 3)
        do[((1, 2, 3),)] # --> tuple containing a tuple, (1, 2, 3)
        do[(1, 2, 3),]   # --> tuple containing a tuple, (1, 2, 3)

    It is possible to use ``unpythonic.misc.pack`` to create a tuple from
    given elements: ``do[pack(1, 2, 3)]`` is interpreted as a single-item body
    that creates a tuple (by calling a function).

    Note the outermost brackets belong to the ``do``; they don't yet create a list.

    In the *use brackets to denote a multi-expr body* syntax (e.g. ``multilambda``,
    ``let`` constructs), the extra brackets already create a list, so in those
    uses, the ambiguity does not arise. The transformation inserts not only the
    word ``do``, but also the outermost brackets. For example::

        let((x, 1),
            (y, 2))[[
              [x, y]]]

    transforms to::

        let((x, 1),
            (y, 2))[do[[  # "do[" is inserted between the two opening brackets
              [x, y]]]]   # and its closing "]" is inserted here

    which already gets rid of the ambiguity.

    **Notes**

    Macros are expanded in an inside-out order, so a nested ``let`` shadows
    names, if the same names appear in the ``do``::

        do[localdef(x << 17),
           let((x, 23))[
             print(x)],  # 23, the "x" of the "let"
           print(x)]     # 17, the "x" of the "do"

    The reason we require local names to be declared is to allow write access
    to lexically outer environments from inside a ``do``::

        let((x, 17))[
              do[x << 23,            # no localdef; update the "x" of the "let"
                 localdef(y << 42),  # "y" is local to the "do"
                 print(x, y)]]

    With the extra bracket syntax, the latter example can be written as::

        let((x, 17))[[
              x << 23,
              localdef(y << 42),
              print(x, y)]]

    It's subtly different in that the first version has the do-items in a tuple,
    whereas this one has them in a list, but the behavior is exactly the same.

    Python does it the other way around, requiring a ``nonlocal`` statement
    to re-bind a name owned by an outer scope.

    The ``let`` constructs solve this problem by having the local bindings
    declared in a separate block, which plays the role of ``localdef``.

def continuations(tree, gen_sym, **kw):
    """[syntax, block] Semi-implicit continuations.

    Roughly, this allows saving the control state and then jumping back later
    (in principle, any time later). Possible use cases:

      - Tree traversal (possibly a cartesian product of multiple trees, with the
        current position in each tracked automatically).

      - McCarthy's amb operator.

    This is a loose pythonification of Paul Graham's continuation-passing macros,
    which implement continuations by chaining closures and passing the continuation
    semi-implicitly. For details, see chapter 20 in On Lisp:

        http://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html

    Continuations are most readily implemented when the program is written in
    continuation-passing style (CPS), but that is unreadable for humans.
    The purpose of this macro is to partly automate the CPS transformation,
    so that at the use site, we can write CPS code in a much more readable fashion.

    To combo with multilambda, use this ordering::

        with multilambda, continuations:
            ...

    A ``with continuations`` block implies TCO; the same rules apply as in a
    ``with tco`` block. Furthermore, ``with continuations`` introduces the
    following additional rules:

      - Functions which make use of continuations, or call other functions that do,
        must be defined within a ``with continuations`` block, using ``def``
        or ``lambda``.

      - All function definitions in a ``with continuations`` block, including
        any nested definitions, must declare a by-name-only formal parameter
        ``cc``::

            with continuations:
                def myfunc(*, cc):
                    ...

                    f = lambda *, cc: ...

      - A ``with continuations`` block will automatically transform all ``def``
        function definitions and ``return`` statements lexically contained within
        it to use the continuation machinery.

        - ``return somevalue`` actually means a tail-call to ``cc`` with the
          given ``somevalue``. Multiple values can be returned as a ``tuple``.

        - An explicit ``return somefunc(arg0, ..., k0=v0, ...)`` actually means
          a tail-call to ``somefunc``, with its ``cc`` automatically set to our
          ``cc``. Hence this inserts a call to ``somefunc`` before proceeding
          with our current continuation.

          Here ``somefunc`` **must** be a continuation-enabled function;
          otherwise the TCO chain will break and the result is immediately
          returned to the top-level caller.

          (If the call succeeds at all; the ``cc`` argument is implicitly
          filled in and passed by name, and most regular functions do not
          have a named parameter ``cc``.)

      - Calls from functions defined in one ``with continuations`` block to those
        defined in another are ok; there is no state or context associated with
        the block.

      - Much of the language works as usual.

        Any non-tail calls can be made normally. Regular functions can be called
        normally in any non-tail position.

        Continuation-enabled functions behave as regular functions when
        called normally; only tail calls implicitly set ``cc``.

      - Combo note:

        ``unpythonic.ec.call_ec`` can be used normally outside any ``with bind``;
        but in a ``with bind`` block, the ``ec`` ceases to be valid. (This is
        because the block is actually a tail call.)

        Usage of ``call_ec`` while inside a ``with continuations`` block is::

            with continuations:
                @call_ec
                def result(ec, *, cc):  # note the signature
                    print("hi")
                    ec(42)
                    print("not reached")
                assert result == 42

                result = call_ec(lambda ec, *, cc: do[print("hi"),
                                                      ec(42),
                                                      print("not reached")])

        See the ``tco`` macro for details on the ``call_ec`` combo.

    **Manipulating the continuation**:

      - Use a ``with bind`` to capture the current continuation. It is almost
        call/cc (call-with-current-continuation), but the continuation is
        explicitly made from the given body.

        To grab a first-class reference to this continuation: it's the ``cc``
        argument of the function being called by the ``with bind``.

        Basically the only case in which ``cc`` will contain something other
        than the default continuation, is while inside the function called
        by a ``with bind``. (So stash it from there.)

        A ``with bind`` works both inside a function definition, and at the
        top level of the ``with continuations`` block.

      - Once you have a captured continuation, to use it, set ``cc=...``
        manually in a tail call. Typical usage::

            def main(*, cc):
                with bind[myfunc()]:  # capture the current continuation...
                    ...               # ...which is this body here

            def myfunc(*, cc):
                ourcc = cc  # save the captured continuation (sent by bind)
                def somefunc(*, cc):
                    return dostuff(..., cc=ourcc)  # and use it here
                somestack.append(somefunc)

        In this example, when ``somefunc`` is called, it will tail-call ``dostuff``
        and then proceed with the continuation ``myfunc`` had at the time when
        that instance of the ``somefunc`` closure was created. In this case,
        that continuation points to the body of the ``with bind`` in ``main``.

      - Instead of setting ``cc``, can also just assign a captured continuation
        to ``cc`` inside a function body. That changes the continuation for the
        rest of the dynamic extent of the function, not only for a particular
        tail call::

            def myfunc(*, cc):
                ourcc = cc
                def somefunc(*, cc):
                    cc = ourcc
                    return dostuff(...)
                somestack.append(somefunc)

    **The call/cc, "with bind"**::

        with bind[func(arg0, ..., k0=v0, ...)] as r:
            body0
            ...

        with bind[func(arg0, ..., k0=v0, ...)] as (r0, ...):
            body0
            ...

    Rules:

      - ``with bind`` may only appear inside a ``with continuations`` block.

      - ``with bind`` is one construct, not two. ``bind`` alone is a syntax error.

      - The function call in the brackets is performed, with the body of the
        with block set as its continuation.

          - By stashing the ``cc`` from inside ``func``, to some place accessible
            from the outside, this allows the body to run multiple times.
            Calling the ``cc`` runs the body again.

            Just like in ``call/cc``, the values that get bound to the as-part
            on second and further calls are the arguments given to the ``cc``
            when it is called.

          - Internally, the body gets transformed into a function definition
            (named using a gensym); it implicitly gets its own ``cc``. Hence,
            the value of ``cc`` inside the body is the **body's** ``cc``.

      - The optional as-part captures the return value of ``func`` (first time),
        and whatever was sent into the continuation (second and further times).

         - To ignore the return value (useful if ``func`` was called only to
           perform its side-effects), just omit the as-part.

         - To destructure a multiple-values (from a tuple return value),
           use a tuple ``(r0, ...)``. **Parentheses are mandatory** due to
           the syntax of Python's ``with`` statement.

           Tupleness is tested at run-time. For literal tuples, the run-time
           check is omitted.

      - When ``with bind`` appears inside a function definition:

          - This is technically a tail call that inserts the call to ``func``
            and the given body before proceeding with the current continuation.

          - The return value of the function containing the ``with bind``
            is the return value of the body of the ``with bind``.

      - When ``with bind`` appears at the top level:

          - A normal call to ``func`` is made, proceeding with the body as the
            continuation.

          - In this case it is not possible to get the return value of the body
            the first time it runs, because ``with`` is a statement.

            If you stash the ``cc`` while inside ``func``, and then call it
            later from the top level, then on any further runs it is possible
            to get its return value as usual.

      - If you need to insert just a tail call (no extra body) before proceeding
        with the current continuation, no need for ``with bind``; use
        ``return func(...)`` instead.

    Examples::

        with tco:

            oddp  = lambda x: (x != 0) and evenp(x - 1)
            assert evenp(10000) is True

                    return True

            def oddp(x):
                if x != 0:
                    return evenp(x - 1)
                return False
            assert evenp(10000) is True

    This is based on a strategy similar to MacroPy's tco macro, but using
    the TCO machinery from ``unpythonic.tco``.

    This recursively handles also builtins ``a if p else b``, ``and``, ``or``;
    and from ``unpythonic.syntax``, ``do[]``, ``let[]``, ``letseq[]``, ``letrec[]``,
    when used in computing a return value.

    Note only calls **in tail position** will be TCO'd. Any other calls
    are left as-is. Tail positions are:

        - The whole return value, if it is just a single call.

        - Both ``a`` and ``b`` branches of ``a if p else b`` (but not ``p``).

        - The last item in an ``and``/``or``. If these are nested, only the
          last item in the whole expression involving ``and``/``or``. E.g. in::

              (1 and 2) or 3
              1 and (2 or 3)

          in either case, only the ``3`` is in tail position.

        - The last item in a ``do[]``.

          - In a ``do0[]``, this is the implicit item that just returns the
            stored return value.

        - The argument of a call to an escape continuation. The ``ec(...)`` call
          itself does not need to be in tail position; escaping early is the
          whole point of an ec.

    All function definitions (``def`` and ``lambda``) lexically inside the block
    undergo TCO transformation. The functions are automatically ``@trampolined``,
    and any tail calls in their return values are converted to ``jump(...)``
    for the TCO machinery.

    Note in a ``def`` you still need the ``return``; it marks a return value.
    But see ``autoreturn``::

        with autoreturn, tco:
            def evenp(x):
                if x == 0:
                    True
                else:
                    oddp(x - 1)
            def oddp(x):
                if x != 0:
                    evenp(x - 1)
                else:
                    False
            assert evenp(10000) is True

    **CAUTION**: regarding escape continuations, only basic uses of ecs created
    via ``call_ec`` are currently detected as being in tail position. Any other
    custom escape mechanisms are not supported. (This is mainly of interest for
    lambdas, which have no ``return``, and for "multi-return" from a nested
    function.)

    *Basic use* is defined as either of these two cases::

        # use as decorator
        @call_ec
        def result(ec):
            ...

        # use directly on a literal lambda
        result = call_ec(lambda ec: ...)

    When macro expansion of the ``with tco`` block starts, names of escape
    continuations created **anywhere lexically within** the ``with tco`` block
    are captured. Lexically within the block, any call to a function having
    any of the captured names, or as a fallback, the literal name ``ec``,
    is interpreted as invoking an escape continuation.

    Each ``def`` function definition lexically within the ``with autoreturn``
    block is examined, and if the last item within the body is an expression
    ``expr``, it is transformed into ``return expr``.

    If the last item is an if/elif/else block, the transformation is applied
    to the last item in each of its branches.

    Example::

        with autoreturn:
            def f():
                "I'll just return this"
            assert f() == "I'll just return this"

            def g(x):
                if x == 1:
                    "one"
                elif x == 2:
                    "two"

            assert g(2) == "two"

    **CAUTION**: If the final ``else`` is omitted, as often in Python, then
    only the ``else`` item is in tail position with respect to the function
    definition - likely not what you want.

    So with ``autoreturn``, the final ``else`` should be written out explicitly,
    to make the ``else`` branch part of the same if/elif/else block.

    **CAUTION**: ``for``, ``async for``, ``while`` are currently not analyzed;
    effectively, these are defined as always returning ``None``. If the last item
    in your function body is a loop, use an explicit return.

    **CAUTION**: With ``autoreturn`` enabled, functions no longer return ``None``
    by default; the whole point of this macro is to change the default return
    value.

    The default return value is ``None`` only if the tail position contains
    a statement (because in a sense, a statement always returns ``None``).

def prefix(tree, **kw):
    """[syntax, block] Write Python like Lisp: the first item is the operator.

    Example::

        with prefix:
            (print, "hello world")
            t1 = (q, 1, 2, (3, 4), 5)
            x = 42
            t2 = (q, 17, 23, x)
            (print, t1, t2)

    Lexically inside a ``with prefix``:

        - A bare ``q`` at the head of a tuple is the quote operator. It increases
          the quote level by one.

          It actually just tells the macro that this tuple (and everything in it,
          recursively) is not a function call.

          Variables can be used as usual, there is no need to unquote them.

        - A bare ``u`` at the head of a tuple is the unquote operator, which
          decreases the quote level by one. In other words, in::

              with prefix:
                  t = (q, 1, 2, (u, print, 3), (print, 4), 5)
                  (print, t)

          the third item will call ``print(3)`` and evaluate to its return value
          (in this case ``None``, since it's ``print``), whereas the fourth item
          is a tuple with the two items ``(<built-in function print>, 4)``.

        - Quote/unquote operators are parsed from the start of the tuple until
          no more remain. Then any remaining items are either returned quoted
          (if quote level > 0), or evaluated as a function call and replaced
          by the return value.

        - How to pass named args::

              from unpythonic.misc import call

              with prefix:
                  (f, kw(myarg=3))  # ``kw(...)`` (syntax, not really a function!)
                  call(f, myarg=3)  # in a call(), kwargs are ok
                  f(myarg=3)        # or just use Python's usual function call syntax

          One ``kw`` operator may include any number of named args (and **only**
          named args). The tuple may have any number of ``kw`` operators.

          All named args are collected from ``kw`` operators in the tuple
          when writing the final function call. If the same kwarg has been
          specified by multiple ``kw`` operators, the rightmost definition wins.

          **Note**: Python itself prohibits having repeated named args in the **same**
          ``kw`` operator, because it uses the function call syntax. If you get a
          `SyntaxError: keyword argument repeated` with no useful traceback,
          check any recent ``kw`` operators you have added in prefix blocks.

          A ``kw(...)`` operator in a quoted tuple (not a function call) is an error.

    Current limitations:

        - passing ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` not supported.

          Workarounds: ``call(...)``; Python's usual function call syntax.

        - For ``*args``, to keep it lispy, maybe you want ``unpythonic.fun.apply``;
          this allows syntax such as ``(apply, f, 1, 2, lst)``.
