def looped(body):
    """Decorator to make a functional loop and run it immediately.

    This essentially chains @trampolined and @call, with some extra magic.

    Parameters:
        `body`: function
          The function to decorate, representing the loop body.

          The first positional parameter of ``body`` is the magic parameter ``loop``.
          It is "self-ish", representing a jump back to the loop body itself.

          The body may take any additional parameters, both positionally and by name.
          Their initial values must be declared as defaults; @looped automatically
          starts the loop by calling ``body`` with the magic ``loop`` parameter
          as the only argument.

    The expression ``loop(...)`` is otherwise the same as ``jump(...)`` to the
    loop body itself, but it also inserts the magic parameter ``loop``, which
    can only be set up via this mechanism.

    **CAUTION**: ``loop`` is a noun, not a verb, because ``unpythonic.tco.jump`` is.

    Simple example::

        @looped
        def result(loop, acc=0, i=0):
            if i == 10:
                return acc
            else:
                return loop(acc + i, i + 1)  # provide the additional parameters
        print(result)

    Imperative body, no meaningful return value::

        @looped
        def _(loop, i=0):
            if i < 3:
                print(i)
                return loop(i + 1)
            # terminated by implicit "return None"

    ``@looped`` is not specifically ``for`` or ``while``, but a general looping
    construct that can express both. FP version of ``while True``::

        @looped
        def _(loop):
            print("Enter your name (or 'q' to quit): ", end='')
            s = input()
            if s.lower() == 'q':
                return  # ...the implicit None. In a "while True:", "break" here.
            else:
                print("Hello, {}!".format(s))
                return loop()

    Strictly, ``@looped`` is just sugar. Consider again the first example.
    These explicit forms are also legal (and slightly faster since no need
    to set up the ``loop`` magic parameter at each iteration)::

        @trampolined
        def s(acc=0, i=0):
            if i == 10:
                return acc
            else:
                return jump(s, acc + i, i + 1)
        s = s()  # when using just @trampolined, must start the loop manually
        print(s)

    If you **really** need to make that into an expression, bind ``r10`` using ``let``,
    or to make your code unreadable, just inline it. Or use ``curry``:

        s = curry(looped_over, range(10), 0,
                    lambda loop, x, acc:

            Essentially, specialized `loop` with the first positional parameter
