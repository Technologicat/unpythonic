"""Tail call optimization / explicit continuations.

Where speed matters, prefer the usual ``for`` and ``while`` constructs.
Where speed *really* matters, add Cython on top of those. And as always,
profile first.

**API reference**:

 - Functions that use TCO must be ``@trampolined``. They are called just like
   any normal function.

 - When inside a ``@trampolined`` function:

   - ``f(a, ..., kw=v, ...)`` is just a normal call, no TCO.

   - ``return jump(f, a, ..., kw=v, ...)`` is a tail call to *target* ``f``.

     - `return` explicitly marks a tail position, naturally enforcing that
       the caller finishes immediately after its purported *tail* call.

   - When done (no more tail calls to make), just return the final result normally.

 - In this module, **"jump" is a noun, not a verb**.

   - Returning a ``jump`` instance makes the trampoline perform the tail call.

   - ``jump(f, ...)`` by itself just evaluates to a jump instance, **doing nothing**.

     - If you're getting ``None`` instead of the result of your computation,
       check for ``jump`` where it should be ``return jump``; and then check
       that you're returning your final result normally.

 - **Lambdas welcome!** For example, ``trampolined(lambda x: ...)``.

   - Just keep in mind how Python expands the decorator syntax; the rest follows.

   - Use the special target ``SELF``, as in ``jump(SELF, ...)``, for tail recursion.

     - Just ``jump``, not ``return jump``, since lambdas do not use ``return``.

   - Or assign the lambda expressions to names; this allows also mutual recursion.

 - **Use only where TCO matters**. Stack traces will be hurt, as usual.

   - Tail recursion is a good use case; so is mutual recursion. Here TCO allows
     elegantly expressed algorithms without blowing the stack.

   - Danger zone is if one applies TCO just because some call happens to be
     in a tail position. This makes debugging a nightmare, since some entries
     will be missing from the call stack.

     This implementation retains the original entry point - due to entering
     the decorator ``trampolined`` - and the final one where the uncaught exception
     actually occurred. Anything in between will have been zapped by TCO.

**Notes**:

Actually it is sufficient that the initial entry point to a computation using
TCO is ``@trampolined``. The trampoline keeps running until a normal value
(i.e. anything that is not a ``jump`` instance) is returned. That normal value
is returned to the original caller.

The ``jump`` constructor automatically strips the target's trampoline,
if it has one - making sure this remains a one-trampoline party even if
the tail-call target is another ``@trampolined`` function. So just declare
anything using TCO as ``@trampolined`` and don't worry about stacking trampolines.

SELF actually means "keep current target", so the last function that was
jumped to by name in that trampoline remains as the target. When the trampoline
starts, the current target is set to the initial entry point (also for lambdas).

Beside TCO, trampolining can also be thought of as *explicit continuations*.
Each trampolined function tells the trampoline where to go next, and with what
parameters. All hail lambda, the ultimate GO TO!

Based on a quick test, running a do-nothing loop with this is about 40-80x
slower than Python's ``for``.

**Examples**::

    # tail recursion
    @trampolined
    def fact(n, acc=1):
        if n == 0:
            return acc
        else:
            return jump(fact, n - 1, n * acc)
    assert fact(4) == 24

    # tail recursion in a lambda
    t = trampolined(lambda n, acc=1:
                        acc if n == 0 else jump(SELF, n - 1, n * acc))
    assert t(4) == 24

    # mutual recursion
    @trampolined
    def even(n):
        if n == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return jump(odd, n - 1)
    @trampolined
    def odd(n):
        if n == 0:
            return False
        else:
            return jump(even, n - 1)

    assert odd(4) is False
