"""Tail call optimization / explicit continuations.

Where speed matters, prefer the usual ``for`` and ``while`` constructs.
Where speed *really* matters, add Cython on top of those. And as always,
profile first.

**API reference**:

 - Functions that use TCO must be ``@trampolined``. They are called just like
   any normal function.

 - When inside a ``@trampolined`` function:

   - ``f(a, ..., kw=v, ...)`` is just a normal call, no TCO.

   - ``return jump(f, a, ..., kw=v, ...)`` is a tail call to *target* ``f``.

     - `return` explicitly marks a tail position, naturally enforcing that
       the caller finishes immediately after its purported *tail* call.

   - When done (no more tail calls to make), just return the final result normally.

 - In this implementation, **"jump" is a noun, not a verb**.

   - Returning a ``jump`` instance makes the trampoline perform the tail call.

   - ``jump(f, ...)`` by itself just evaluates to a jump instance, **doing nothing**.

     - If you're getting ``None`` instead of the result of your computation,
       check for ``jump`` where it should be ``return jump``; and then check
       that you're returning your final result normally.

       Most often you'll get "unclaimed jump" warnings printed to stderr if you
       run into this.

 - **Lambdas welcome!** For example, ``trampolined(lambda x: ...)``.

   - Just keep in mind how Python expands the decorator syntax; the rest follows.

   - For tail recursion, use ``unpythonic.fun.withself`` (see below for an example).

   - Just ``jump``, not ``return jump``, since lambdas do not use ``return``.

   - Or assign the lambda expressions to names; this allows also mutual recursion.

 - **Use only where TCO matters**. Stack traces will be hurt, as usual.

   - Tail recursion is a good use case; so is mutual recursion. Here TCO allows
     elegantly expressed algorithms without blowing the stack.

   - Danger zone is if one applies TCO just because some call happens to be
     in a tail position. This makes debugging a nightmare, since some entries
     will be missing from the call stack.

     This implementation retains the original entry point - due to entering
     the decorator ``trampolined`` - and the final one where the uncaught exception
     actually occurred. Anything in between will have been zapped by TCO.

**Notes**:

Actually it is sufficient that the initial entry point to a computation using
TCO is ``@trampolined``. The trampoline keeps running until a normal value
(i.e. anything that is not a ``jump`` instance) is returned. That normal value
is returned to the original caller.

The ``jump`` constructor automatically strips the target's trampoline,
if it has one - making sure this remains a one-trampoline party even if
the tail-call target is another ``@trampolined`` function. So just declare
anything using TCO as ``@trampolined`` and don't worry about stacking trampolines.

Beside TCO, trampolining can also be thought of as *explicit continuations*.
Each trampolined function tells the trampoline where to go next, and with what
parameters. All hail lambda, the ultimate GO TO!

Based on a quick test, running a do-nothing loop with this is about 40-80x
slower than Python's ``for``.

**Examples**::

    # tail recursion
    @trampolined
    def fact(n, acc=1):
        if n == 0:
            return acc
        else:
            return jump(fact, n - 1, n * acc)
    assert fact(4) == 24

    # tail recursion in a lambda
    t = trampolined(withself(lambda self, n, acc=1:
                               acc if n == 0 else jump(self, n - 1, n * acc)))
    assert t(4) == 24
    t(5000)  # no crash

    # mutual recursion
    @trampolined
    def even(n):
        if n == 0:
            return True
        else:
            return jump(odd, n - 1)
    @trampolined
    def odd(n):
        if n == 0:
            return False
        else:
            return jump(even, n - 1)
    assert even(42) is True
    assert odd(4) is False

        return jump(bar)

        **CAUTION**:

            This warning mechanism should help find bugs, but it is not 100% foolproof.

            not get their ``__del__`` called when the Python interpreter itself exits

            @trampolined
            def foo():
                jump(bar, 42)

        The jump instance was never actually passed to the trampoline; it was
        just created and discarded. The trampoline got the ``None`` from the
        implicit ``return None`` at the end of the function.

        *No trampoline*::

            def foo():
                return jump(bar, 42)

        Here ``foo`` is not trampolined.

        We **have** a trampoline when the function that returns the jump
        instance is itself ``@trampolined``, or is running in a trampoline
        implicitly (due to having been entered via a tail call).

        *Trampoline at the wrong level*::

            @trampolined
            def foo():
                def bar():
                    return jump(qux, 23)
                bar()  # normal call, no TCO

        Here ``bar`` has no trampoline; only ``foo`` does. **Only** a ``@trampolined``
        function, or a function entered via a tail call, may return a jump.
