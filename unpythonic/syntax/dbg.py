        [/home/developer/codes/foo.py:42] x: 2, y: 3, (17 + 23): 40

    Parameters:

        ``ks``: ``tuple``
            expressions as strings

        ``vs``: ``tuple``
            the corresponding values

        ``lineno``: number or ``None``
            line number where the debug print call occurred

        ``sep``: ``str``
            separator as in built-in ``print``,

        ``kwargs``: anything

    **Implementing a custom debug printer**:

    When implementing a custom print function, it **must** accept two
    positional arguments, ``ks`` and ``vs``, and two by-name arguments,
    ``filename`` and ``lineno``.

    It may also accept other arguments (see built-in ``print``), or just
    ``**kwargs`` them through to the built-in ``print``, if you like.

    Other arguments are only needed if the print calls in the ``dbg`` sections
    of your client code use them. (To be flexible, this default debug printer
    supports ``sep`` and passes everything else through.)

    The ``lineno`` argument may be ``None`` if the input resulted from macro
    expansion and the macro that generated it didn't bother to fill in the
    ``lineno`` attribute of the AST node.
