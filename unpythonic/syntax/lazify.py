# lazyrec: syntax transformer, recursively lazify elements in container literals
#
# **CAUTION**: There are some containers whose constructors appear as a Call node,
# and also ``list``, ``tuple`` and ``set`` can be created via explicit calls.
#
# To treat these cases correctly, we must know which arguments to the
# constructors refer to other containers (to be unpacked into the new one)
# and which refer to atoms (to be added as individual items).
#
# Args that represent atoms should be lazified, so that they enter the container
# as lazy items.
#
# For args that represent containers:
#
#   - Args that opaquely refer to an existing container should not be lazified,
#     to avoid interfering with their unpacking.
#
#   - Args where the value is a literal container should be lazified by descending
#     into it, to lazify its items.
#
# For example::
#
#     s = {1, 2, 3}
#     fs = frozenset(s)          # opaque container argument, do nothing
#     fs = frozenset({1, 2, 3})  # literal container argument, descend
#
#     d1 = {'a': 'foo', 'b': 'bar'}
#     d2 = {'c': 'baz'}
#     fd = frozendict(d1, d2, d='qux')  # d1, d2 opaque containers; any kws are atoms
#     fd = frozendict({1: 2, 3: 4}, d2, d='qux')  # literal container, opaque container, atom
#
# In any case, *args and **kwargs are lazified only if literal containers;
# whatever they are, the result must be unpackable to perform the function call.

# Note we do **not** lazify the RHS of assignments. This is one place where
# explicit is better than implicit; with auto-lazification of assignment RHSs
# it is too easy to accidentally set up an infinite recursion.
#
# This is ok:
#   force1(lst)[0] = (10 * (force1(lst()[0]) if isinstance(lst, Lazy1) else force1(lst[0])))
#
# but this blows up (by infinite recursion) later when we eventually force lst[0]:
#   force1(lst)[0] = Lazy1(lambda: (10 * (force1(lst()[0]) if isinstance(lst, Lazy1) else force1(lst[0]))))
#
# We **could** solve this by forcing and capturing the current value before assigning,
# instead of allowing the RHS to refer to a lazy list element. But on the other hand,
# that's a **use** of the current value, so we may as well do nothing, causing
# the RHS to be evaluated, without the need to have any extra code here. :)

# TODO: other binding constructs?
#   - keep in mind that force(x) == x if x is a non-promise atom, so a wrapper is not needed
#   - don't lazify "with", eager init is the whole point of a context manager
#   - don't lazify "for", the loop counter changes value imperatively (and usually rather rapidly)

    # Tail-calling from a strict function into a lazy function should work, because
    # all arguments are evaluated at the strict side before the call is made.
    #
    # But tail-calling strict -> lazy -> strict will fail in some cases.
    # The second strict callee may get promises instead of values, because the
    # strict trampoline does not have the lazycall (that usually forces the args
    # when lazy code calls into strict code).
