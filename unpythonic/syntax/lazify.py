    Essentially, this distributes ``lazy[]`` into the items inside a literal
    ``list``, ``tuple``, ``set``, ``frozenset``, ``unpythonic.collections.box``
    or ``unpythonic.llist.cons``, and into the values of a literal ``dict`` or
    ``unpythonic.collections.frozendict``.

    Because this is a macro and must work by names only, only this fixed set of
    container types is supported.

    The container itself is not lazified, only the items inside it are, to keep
    the lazification from interfering with unpacking. This allows things such as
    ``f(*lazyrec[(1*2*3, 4*5*6)])`` to work as expected.

    See also ``lazy[]`` (the effect on each item) and ``unpythonic.syntax.force``
    (the inverse of ``lazyrec[]``).

    For an atom, ``lazyrec[]`` has the same effect as ``lazy[]``::

        lazyrec[dostuff()] --> lazy[dostuff()]

    For a container literal, ``lazyrec[]`` descends into it::

        lazyrec[(2*21, 1/0)] --> (lazy[2*21], lazy[1/0])
        lazyrec[{'a': 2*21, 'b': 1/0}] --> {'a': lazy[2*21], 'b': lazy[1/0]}

    Constructor call syntax for container literals is also supported::

        lazyrec[list(2*21, 1/0)] --> [lazy[2*21], lazy[1/0]]

    Nested container literals (with any combination of known types) are
    processed recursively, for example::

        lazyrec[((2*21, 1/0), (1+2+3, 4+5+6))] --> ((lazy[2*21], lazy[1/0]),
                                                    (lazy[1+2+3], lazy[4+5+6]))

def lazify(tree, *, syntax, expander, **kw):
    """[syntax, block] Call-by-need for Python.

    In a ``with lazify`` block, function arguments are evaluated only when
    actually used, at most once each, and in the order in which they are
    actually used. Promises are automatically forced on access.

    Automatic lazification applies to arguments in function calls and to
    let-bindings, since they play a similar role. **No other binding forms
    are auto-lazified.**

    Automatic lazification uses the ``lazyrec[]`` macro, which recurses into
    certain types of container literals, so that the lazification will not
    interfere with unpacking. See its docstring for details.

    Comboing with other block macros in ``unpythonic.syntax`` is supported,
    including ``curry`` and ``continuations``.

    Silly contrived example::

        with lazify:
            def my_if(p, a, b):
                if p:
                    return a  # b never evaluated in this code path...
                else:
                    return b  # a never evaluated in this code path...

            # ...hence the divisions by zero here are never performed.
            assert my_if(True, 23, 1/0) == 23
            assert my_if(False, 1/0, 42) == 42

    Note ``my_if`` is a run-of-the-mill runtime function, not a macro. Only the
    ``with lazify`` is imbued with any magic.

    Like ``with continuations``, no state or context is associated with a
    ``with lazify`` block, so lazy functions defined in one block may call
    those defined in another. Calls between lazy and strict code are also
    supported (in both directions), without requiring any extra effort.

    Evaluation of each lazified argument is guaranteed to occur at most once;
    the value is cached. Order of evaluation of lazy arguments is determined
    by the (dynamic) order in which the lazy code actually uses them.

    Essentially, the above code expands into::

        from unpythonic.syntax import macros, lazy
        from unpythonic.syntax import force

        def my_if(p, a, b):
            if force(p):
                return force(a)
            else:
                return force(b)
        assert my_if(lazy[True], lazy[23], lazy[1/0]) == 23
        assert my_if(lazy[False], lazy[1/0], lazy[42]) == 42

    plus some clerical details to allow lazy and strict code to be mixed.

    Just passing through a lazy argument to another lazy function will
    not trigger evaluation, even when it appears in a computation inlined
    to the argument list::

        with lazify:
            def g(a, b):
                return a
            def f(a, b):
                return g(2*a, 3*b)
            assert f(21, 1/0) == 42

    The division by zero is never performed, because the value of ``b`` is
    not needed to compute the result (worded less magically, that promise is
    never forced in the code path that produces the result). Essentially,
    the above code expands into::

        from unpythonic.syntax import macros, lazy
        from unpythonic.syntax import force

        def g(a, b):
            return force(a)
        def f(a, b):
            return g(lazy[2*force(a)], lazy[3*force(b)])
        assert f(lazy[21], lazy[1/0]) == 42

    This relies on the magic of closures to capture f's ``a`` and ``b`` into
    the promises.

    But be careful; **assignments are not auto-lazified**, so the following does
    **not** work::

        with lazify:
            def g(a, b):
                return a
            def f(a, b):
                c = 3*b  # not in an arglist, b gets evaluated!
                return g(2*a, c)
            assert f(21, 1/0) == 42

    To avoid that, explicitly wrap the computation into a ``lazy[]``. For why
    assignment RHSs are not auto-lazified, see the section on pitfalls below.

    In calls, bare references (name, subscript, attribute) are detected and for
    them, re-thunking is skipped. For example::

        def g(a):
            return a
        def f(a):
            return g(a)
        assert f(42) == 42

    expands into::

        def g(a):
            return force(a)
        def f(a):
            return g(a)  # <-- no lazy[force(a)] since "a" is just a name
        assert f(lazy[42]) == 42

    When resolving references, subscripts and attributes are forced just enough
    to obtain the containing object from a promise, if any; for example, the
    elements of a list ``lst`` will not be evaluated just because the user code
    happens to use ``lst.append(...)``; this only forces the object ``lst``
    itself.

    A ``lst`` appearing by itself evaluates the whole list. Similarly, ``lst[0]``
    by itself evaluates only the first element, and ``lst[:-1]`` by itself
    evaluates all but the last element. The index expression in a subscript is
    fully forced, because its value is needed to determine which elements of the
    subscripted container are to be accessed.

    **Mixing lazy and strict code**

    Lazy code is allowed to call strict functions and vice versa, without
    requiring any additional effort.

    Keep in mind what this implies: when calling a strict function, any arguments
    given to it will be evaluated!

    In the other direction, when calling a lazy function from strict code, the
    arguments are evaluated by the caller before the lazy code gets control.
    The lazy code gets just the evaluated values.

    If you have, in strict code, an argument expression you want to pass lazily,
    use syntax like ``f(lazy[...], ...)``. If you accidentally do this in lazy
    code, it shouldn't break anything; ``with lazify`` detects any argument
    expressions that are already promises, and just passes them through.

    **Forcing promises manually**

    This is mainly useful if you ``lazy[]`` or ``lazyrec[]`` something explicitly,
    and want to compute its value outside a ``with lazify`` block.

    We provide the functions ``force1`` and ``force``.

    Using ``force1``, if ``x`` is a ``lazy[]`` promise, it will be forced,
    and the resulting value is returned. If ``x`` is not a promise,
    ``x`` itself is returned, Ã  la Racket.

    The function ``force``, in addition, descends into containers (recursively).
    When an atom ``x`` (i.e. anything that is not a container) is encountered,
    it is processed using ``force1``.

    Mutable containers are updated in-place; for immutables, a new instance is
    created. Any container with a compatible ``collections.abc`` is supported.
    (See ``unpythonic.collections.mogrify`` for details.) In addition, as
    special cases ``unpythonic.collections.box`` and ``unpythonic.llist.cons``
    are supported.

    **Tips, tricks and pitfalls**

    You can mix and match bare data values and promises, since ``force(x)``
    evaluates to ``x`` when ``x`` is not a promise.

    So this is just fine::

        with lazify:
            def f(x):
                x = 2*21  # assign a bare data value
                print(x)  # the implicit force(x) evaluates to x
            f(17)

    If you want to manually introduce a promise, use ``lazy[]``::

        from unpythonic.syntax import macros, lazify, lazy

        with lazify:
            def f(x):
                x = lazy[2*21]  # assign a promise
                print(x)        # the implicit force(x) evaluates the promise
            f(17)

    If you have a container literal and want to lazify it recursively in a
    position that does not auto-lazify, use ``lazyrec[]`` (see its docstring
    for details)::

        from unpythonic.syntax import macros, lazify, lazyrec

        with lazify:
            def f(x):
                return x[:-1]
            lst = lazyrec[[1, 2, 3/0]]
            assert f(lst) == [1, 2]

    For non-literal containers, use ``lazy[]`` for each item as appropriate::

        def f(lst):
            lst.append(lazy["I'm lazy"])
            lst.append(lazy["Don't call me lazy, I'm just evaluated later!"])

    Keep in mind, though, that ``lazy[]`` will introduce a lambda, so there's
    the usual pitfall::

        from unpythonic.syntax import macros, lazify, lazy

        with lazify:
            lst = []
            for x in range(3):       # DANGER: only one "x", mutated imperatively
                lst.append(lazy[x])  # all these closures capture the same "x"
            print(lst[0])  # 2
            print(lst[1])  # 2
            print(lst[2])  # 2

    So to capture the value instead of the name, use the usual workaround,
    the wrapper lambda (here written more readably as a let, which it really is)::

        from unpythonic.syntax import macros, lazify, lazy, let

        with lazify:
            lst = []
            for x in range(3):
                lst.append(let[[y << x] in lazy[y]])
            print(lst[0])  # 0
            print(lst[1])  # 1
            print(lst[2])  # 2

    Be careful not to ``lazy[]`` or ``lazyrec[]`` too much::

        with lazify:
            a = 10
            a = lazy[2*a]  # 20, right?
            print(a)       # crash!

    Why does this example crash? The expanded code is::

        with lazify:
            a = 10
            a = lazy[2*force(a)]
            print(force(a))

    The ``lazy[]`` sets up a promise, which will force ``a`` *at the time when
    the containing promise is forced*, but at that time the name ``a`` points
    to a promise, which will force...

    The fundamental issue is that ``a = 2*a`` is an imperative update; if you
    need to do that, just let Python evaluate the RHS normally (i.e. use the
    value the name ``a`` points to *at the time when the RHS runs*).

    Assigning a lazy value to a new name evaluates it, because any read access
    triggers evaluation::

        with lazify:
            def g(x):
                y = x       # the "x" on the RHS triggers the implicit force
                print(y)    # bare data value
            f(2*21)

    Inspired by Haskell, Racket's (delay) and (force), and lazy/racket.

    **Combos**

    Introducing the *HasThon* programming language (it has 100% more Thon than
    popular brands)::

        with lazify, autocurry:
            def add2first(a, b, c):
                return a + b
            assert add2first(2)(3)(1/0) == 5

            def f(a, b):
                return a
            assert let[[c << 42,
                        d << 1/0] in f(c)(d)] == 42
            assert letrec[[c << 42,
                           d << 1/0,
                           e << 2*c] in f(e)(d)] == 84

            assert letrec[[c << 42,
                           d << 1/0,
                           e << 2*c] in [local[x << f(e)(d)],
                                         x/4]] == 21

    Works also with continuations. Rules:

      - Also continuations are transformed into lazy functions.

      - ``cc`` built by chain_conts is treated as lazy, **itself**; then it's
        up to the continuations chained by it to decide whether to force their
        arguments.

      - The default continuation ``identity`` is strict, so that return values
        from a continuation-enabled computation will be forced.

        If you need a lazy ``identity`` (so that you can obtain those delicious
        promises), use::

            from unpythonic import identity
            from unpythonic.lazyutil import passthrough_lazy_args
            lazy_identity = passthrough_lazy_args(identity)

        and then explicitly set the kwarg `cc=lazy_identity` when invoking the
        continuation-enabled computation (e.g. in the example below, we could
        `ourpromises = doit(cc=lazy_identity)`).

    Example::

        with lazify, continuations:
            k = None
            def setk(*args, cc):
                nonlocal k
                k = cc
                return args[0]
            def doit():
                lst = ['the call returned']
                *more, = call_cc[setk('A', 1/0)]
                return lst + [more[0]]
            assert doit() == ['the call returned', 'A']
            assert k('again') == ['the call returned', 'again']
            assert k('thrice', 1/0) == ['the call returned', 'thrice']

    **CAUTION**: Call-by-need is a low-level language feature that is difficult
    to bolt on after the fact. Some things might not work.

    **CAUTION**: The functions in ``unpythonic.fun`` are lazify-aware (so that
    e.g. curry and compose work with lazy functions), as are ``call`` and
    ``callwith`` in ``unpythonic.misc``, but the rest of ``unpythonic`` is not.

    **CAUTION**: Argument passing by function call, and let-bindings are
    currently the only binding constructs to which auto-lazification is applied.

    # Pay-as-you-go: to avoid a drastic performance hit (~10x) in trampolines
    # built by unpythonic.tco.trampolined for regular strict code, a special mode
    # must be enabled to build lazify-aware trampolines.
    #
    # The idea is that the mode is enabled while any function definitions in the
    # "with lazify" block run, so they get a lazify-aware trampoline.
    # This should be determined lexically, but that's complicated to do API-wise,
    # so we currently enable the mode for the dynamic extent of the "with lazify".
    # Usually this is close enough; the main case where this can behave
    # unexpectedly is::
    #
    #     @trampolined  # strict trampoline
    #     def g():
    #         ...
    #
    #     def make_f():
    #         @trampolined  # which kind of trampoline is this?
    #         def f():
    #             ...
    #         return f
    #
    #     f1 = make_f()  # f1 gets the strict trampoline
    #
    #     with lazify:
    #         @trampolined  # lazify-aware trampoline
    #         def h():
    #             ...
    #
    #         f2 = make_f()  # f2 gets the lazify-aware trampoline
    #
    # TCO chains with an arbitrary mix of lazy and strict functions should work
    # as long as the first function in the chain has a lazify-aware trampoline,
    # because the chain runs under the trampoline of the first function.
    #
    # Tail-calling from a strict function into a lazy function should work, because
    # all arguments are evaluated at the strict side before the call is made.
    #
    # But tail-calling strict -> lazy -> strict will fail in some cases.
    # The second strict callee may get promises instead of values, because the
    # strict trampoline does not have the maybe_force_args (that usually forces the args
    # when lazy code calls into strict code).
