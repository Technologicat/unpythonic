# lazyrec: syntax transformer, recursively lazify elements in container literals
#
# **CAUTION**: There are some containers whose constructors appear as a Call node,
# and also ``list``, ``tuple`` and ``set`` can be created via explicit calls.
#
# To treat these cases correctly, we must know which arguments to the
# constructors refer to other containers (to be unpacked into the new one)
# and which refer to atoms (to be added as individual items).
#
# Args that represent atoms should be lazified, so that they enter the container
# as lazy items.
#
# For args that represent containers:
#
#   - Args that opaquely refer to an existing container should not be lazified,
#     to avoid interfering with their unpacking.
#
#   - Args where the value is a literal container should be lazified by descending
#     into it, to lazify its items.
#
# For example::
#
#     s = {1, 2, 3}
#     fs = frozenset(s)          # opaque container argument, do nothing
#     fs = frozenset({1, 2, 3})  # literal container argument, descend
#
#     d1 = {'a': 'foo', 'b': 'bar'}
#     d2 = {'c': 'baz'}
#     fd = frozendict(d1, d2, d='qux')  # d1, d2 opaque containers; any kws are atoms
#     fd = frozendict({1: 2, 3: 4}, d2, d='qux')  # literal container, opaque container, atom
#
# In any case, *args and **kwargs are lazified only if literal containers;
# whatever they are, the result must be unpackable to perform the function call.
