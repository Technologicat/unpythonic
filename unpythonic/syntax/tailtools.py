def autoreturn(tree, *, syntax, **kw):
    """[syntax, block] Implicit "return" in tail position, like in Lisps.

    Each ``def`` function definition lexically within the ``with autoreturn``
    block is examined, and if the last item within the body is an expression
    ``expr``, it is transformed into ``return expr``.

    If the last item is an if/elif/else block, the transformation is applied
    to the last item in each of its branches.

    If the last item is a ``with`` or ``async with`` block, the transformation
    is applied to the last item in its body.

    If the last item is a try/except/else/finally block, the rules are as follows.
    If an ``else`` clause is present, the transformation is applied to the last
    item in it; otherwise, to the last item in the ``try`` clause. Additionally,
    in both cases, the transformation is applied to the last item in each of the
    ``except`` clauses. The ``finally`` clause is not transformed; the intention
    is it is usually a finalizer (e.g. to release resources) that runs after the
    interesting value is already being returned by ``try``, ``else`` or ``except``.

    Example::

        with autoreturn:
            def f():
                "I'll just return this"
            assert f() == "I'll just return this"

            def g(x):
                if x == 1:
                    "one"
                elif x == 2:
                    "two"
                else:
                    "something else"
            assert g(1) == "one"
            assert g(2) == "two"
            assert g(42) == "something else"

    **CAUTION**: If the final ``else`` is omitted, as often in Python, then
    only the ``else`` item is in tail position with respect to the function
    definition - likely not what you want.

    So with ``autoreturn``, the final ``else`` should be written out explicitly,
    to make the ``else`` branch part of the same if/elif/else block.

    **CAUTION**: ``for``, ``async for``, ``while`` are currently not analyzed;
    effectively, these are defined as always returning ``None``. If the last item
    in your function body is a loop, use an explicit return.

    **CAUTION**: With ``autoreturn`` enabled, functions no longer return ``None``
    by default; the whole point of this macro is to change the default return
    value.

    The default return value is ``None`` only if the tail position contains
    a statement (because in a sense, a statement always returns ``None``).

    Examples::

            oddp  = lambda x: (x != 0) and evenp(x - 1)

                return False
            assert evenp(10000) is True

    This is based on a strategy similar to MacroPy's tco macro, but using
    the TCO machinery from ``unpythonic.tco``.

    This recursively handles also builtins ``a if p else b``, ``and``, ``or``;
    and from ``unpythonic.syntax``, ``do[]``, ``let[]``, ``letseq[]``, ``letrec[]``,
    when used in computing a return value. (``aif[]`` and ``cond[]`` also work.)

    Note only calls **in tail position** will be TCO'd. Any other calls
    are left as-is. Tail positions are:

        - The whole return value, if it is just a single call.

        - Both ``a`` and ``b`` branches of ``a if p else b`` (but not ``p``).

        - The last item in an ``and``/``or``. If these are nested, only the
          last item in the whole expression involving ``and``/``or``. E.g. in::

              (a and b) or c
              a and (b or c)

          in either case, only ``c`` is in tail position, regardless of the
          values of ``a``, ``b``.

        - The last item in a ``do[]``.

          - In a ``do0[]``, this is the implicit item that just returns the
            stored return value.

        - The argument of a call to an escape continuation. The ``ec(...)`` call
          itself does not need to be in tail position; escaping early is the
          whole point of an ec.

    All function definitions (``def`` and ``lambda``) lexically inside the block
    undergo TCO transformation. The functions are automatically ``@trampolined``,
    and any tail calls in their return values are converted to ``jump(...)``
    for the TCO machinery.

    Note in a ``def`` you still need the ``return``; it marks a return value.
    But see ``autoreturn``::

        with autoreturn, tco:
            def evenp(x):
                if x == 0:
                    True
                else:
                    oddp(x - 1)
            def oddp(x):
                if x != 0:
                    evenp(x - 1)
                else:
                    False
            assert evenp(10000) is True

    **CAUTION**: regarding escape continuations, only basic uses of ecs created
    via ``call_ec`` are currently detected as being in tail position. Any other
    custom escape mechanisms are not supported. (This is mainly of interest for
    lambdas, which have no ``return``, and for "multi-return" from a nested
    function.)

    *Basic use* is defined as either of these two cases::

        # use as decorator
        @call_ec
        def result(ec):
            ...

        # use directly on a literal lambda (effectively, as a decorator)
        result = call_ec(lambda ec: ...)

    When macro expansion of the ``with tco`` block starts, names of escape
    continuations created **anywhere lexically within** the ``with tco`` block
    are captured. Lexically within the block, any call to a function having
    any of the captured names, or as a fallback, one of the literal names
    ``ec``, ``brk``, ``throw`` is interpreted as invoking an escape
    continuation.

    This allows saving the control state and then jumping back later
    (in principle, any time later). Some possible use cases:

      - Tree traversal (possibly a cartesian product of multiple trees, with the
        current position in each tracked automatically).

      - McCarthy's amb operator.

      - Generators. (Python already has those, so only for teaching.)

    This is a very loose pythonification of Paul Graham's continuation-passing
    macros, which implement continuations by chaining closures and passing the
    continuation semi-implicitly. For details, see chapter 20 in On Lisp:

        http://paulgraham.com/onlisp.html

    Continuations are most readily implemented when the program is written in
    continuation-passing style (CPS), but that is unreadable for humans.
    The purpose of this macro is to partly automate the CPS transformation, so
    that at the use site, we can write CPS code in a much more readable fashion.

    A ``with continuations`` block implies TCO; the same rules apply as in a
    ``with tco`` block. Furthermore, ``with continuations`` introduces the
    following additional rules:

      - Functions which make use of continuations, or call other functions that do,
        must be defined within a ``with continuations`` block, using the usual
        ``def`` or ``lambda`` forms.

      - All function definitions in a ``with continuations`` block, including
        any nested definitions, have an implicit formal parameter ``cc``,
        **even if not explicitly declared** in the formal parameter list.

        If declared explicitly, ``cc`` must be in a position that can accept a
        default value.

        This means ``cc`` must be declared either as by-name-only::

            with continuations:
                def myfunc(a, b, *, cc):
                    ...

                    f = lambda *, cc: ...

        or as the last parameter that has no default::

            with continuations:
                def myfunc(a, b, cc):
                    ...

                    f = lambda cc: ...

        Then the continuation machinery will automatically set the default value
        of ``cc`` to the default continuation (``identity``), which just returns
        its arguments.

        The most common use case for explicitly declaring ``cc`` is that the
        function is the target of a ``call_cc[]``; then it helps readability
        to make the ``cc`` parameter explicit.

      - A ``with continuations`` block will automatically transform all
        function definitions and ``return`` statements lexically contained
        within the block to use the continuation machinery.

        - ``return somevalue`` actually means a tail-call to ``cc`` with the
          given ``somevalue``.

          Multiple values can be returned as a ``Values``. Multiple-valueness
          is tested at run time.

          Any ``Values`` return value is automatically unpacked to the args
          and kwargs of ``cc``.

        - An explicit ``return somefunc(arg0, ..., k0=v0, ...)`` actually means
          a tail-call to ``somefunc``, with its ``cc`` automatically set to our
          ``cc``. Hence this inserts a call to ``somefunc`` before proceeding
          with our current continuation. (This is most often what we want when
          making a tail-call from a continuation-enabled function.)

          Here ``somefunc`` **must** be a continuation-enabled function;
          otherwise the TCO chain will break and the result is immediately
          returned to the top-level caller.

          (If the call succeeds at all; the ``cc`` argument is implicitly
          filled in and passed by name. Regular functions usually do not
          accept a named parameter ``cc``, let alone know what to do with it.)

        - Just like in ``with tco``, a lambda body is analyzed as one big
          return-value expression. This uses the exact same analyzer; for example,
          ``do[]`` (including any implicit ``do[]``) and the ``let[]`` expression
          family are supported.

      - Calls from functions defined in one ``with continuations`` block to those
        defined in another are ok; there is no state or context associated with
        the block.

      - Much of the language works as usual.

        Any non-tail calls can be made normally. Regular functions can be called
        normally in any non-tail position.

        Continuation-enabled functions behave as regular functions when
        called normally; only tail calls implicitly set ``cc``. A normal call
        uses ``identity`` as the default ``cc``.

      - For technical reasons, the ``return`` statement is not allowed at the
        top level of the ``with continuations:`` block. (Because a continuation
        is essentially a function, ``return`` would behave differently based on
        whether it is placed lexically before or after a ``call_cc[]``.)

        If you absolutely need to terminate the function surrounding the
        ``with continuations:`` block from inside the block, use an exception
        to escape; see ``call_ec``, ``catch``, ``throw``.

    **Capturing the continuation**:

    Inside a ``with continuations:`` block, the ``call_cc[]`` statement
    captures a continuation. (It is actually a macro, for technical reasons.)

    For various possible program topologies that continuations may introduce, see
    the clarifying pictures under ``doc/`` in the source distribution.

    Syntax::

        x = call_cc[func(...)]
        *xs = call_cc[func(...)]
        x0, ... = call_cc[func(...)]
        x0, ..., *xs = call_cc[func(...)]
        call_cc[func(...)]

    Conditional variant::

        x = call_cc[f(...) if p else g(...)]
        *xs = call_cc[f(...) if p else g(...)]
        x0, ... = call_cc[f(...) if p else g(...)]
        x0, ..., *xs = call_cc[f(...) if p else g(...)]
        call_cc[f(...) if p else g(...)]

    Assignment targets:

     - To destructure positional multiple-values (from a `Values` return value),
       use a tuple assignment target (comma-separated names, as usual).

       Destructuring *named* return values from a `call_cc` is currently not supported.

     - The last assignment target may be starred. It is transformed into
       the vararg (a.k.a. ``*args``) of the continuation function.
       (It will capture a whole tuple, or any excess items, as usual.)

     - To ignore the return value (useful if ``func`` was called only to
       perform its side-effects), just omit the assignment part.

    Conditional variant:

     - ``p`` is any expression. If truthy, ``f(...)`` is called, and if falsey,
       ``g(...)`` is called.

     - Each of ``f(...)``, ``g(...)`` may be ``None``. A ``None`` skips the
       function call, proceeding directly to the continuation. Upon skipping,
       all assignment targets (if any are present) are set to ``None``.
       The starred assignment target (if present) gets the empty tuple.

     - The main use case of the conditional variant is for things like::

           with continuations:
               k = None
               def setk(cc):
                   global k
                   k = cc
               def dostuff(x):
                   call_cc[setk() if x > 10 else None]  # capture only if x > 10
                   ...

    To keep things relatively straightforward, a ``call_cc[]`` is only
    allowed to appear **at the top level** of:

      - the ``with continuations:`` block itself
      - a ``def`` or ``async def``

    Nested defs are ok; here *top level* only means the top level of the
    *currently innermost* ``def``.

    If you need to place ``call_cc[]`` inside a loop, use ``@looped`` et al.
    from ``unpythonic.fploop``; this has the loop body represented as the
    top level of a ``def``.

    Multiple ``call_cc[]`` statements in the same function body are allowed.
    These essentially create nested closures.

    **Main differences to Scheme and Racket**:

    Compared to Scheme/Racket, where ``call/cc`` will capture also expressions
    occurring further up in the call stack, our ``call_cc`` may be need to be
    placed differently (further out, depending on what needs to be captured)
    due to the delimited nature of the continuations implemented here.

    Scheme and Racket implicitly capture the continuation at every position,
    whereas we do it explicitly, only at the use sites of the ``call_cc`` macro.

    Also, since there are limitations to where a ``call_cc[]`` may appear, some
    code may need to be structured differently to do some particular thing, if
    porting code examples originally written in Scheme or Racket.

    Unlike ``call/cc`` in Scheme/Racket, ``call_cc`` takes **a function call**
    as its argument, not just a function reference. Also, there's no need for
    it to be a one-argument function; any other args can be passed in the call.
    The ``cc`` argument is filled implicitly and passed by name; any others are
    passed exactly as written in the client code.

    **Technical notes**:

    The ``call_cc[]`` statement essentially splits its use site into *before*
    and *after* parts, where the *after* part (the continuation) can be run
    a second and further times, by later calling the callable that represents
    the continuation. This makes a computation resumable from a desired point.

    The return value of the continuation is whatever the original function
    returns, for any ``return`` statement that appears lexically after the
    ``call_cc[]``.

    The effect of ``call_cc[]`` is that the function call ``func(...)`` in
    the brackets is performed, with its ``cc`` argument set to the lexically
    remaining statements of the current ``def`` (at the top level, the rest
    of the ``with continuations`` block), represented as a callable.

    The continuation itself ends there (it is *delimited* in this particular
    sense), but it will chain to the ``cc`` of the function it appears in.
    This is termed the *parent continuation* (**pcc**), stored in the internal
    variable ``_pcc`` (which defaults to ``None``).

    Via the use of the pcc, here ``f`` will maintain the illusion of being
    just one function, even though a ``call_cc`` appears there::

        def f(*, cc):
            ...
            call_cc[g(1, 2, 3)]
            ...

    The continuation is a closure. For its pcc, it will use the value the
    original function's ``cc`` had when the definition of the continuation
    was executed (for that particular instance of the closure). Hence, calling
    the original function again with its ``cc`` set to something else will
    produce a new continuation instance that chains into that new ``cc``.

    The continuation's own ``cc`` will be ``identity``, to allow its use just
    like any other function (also as argument of a ``call_cc`` or target of a
    tail call).

    When the pcc is set (not ``None``), the effect is to run the pcc first,
    and ``cc`` only after that. This preserves the whole captured tail of a
    computation also in the presence of nested ``call_cc`` invocations (in the
    above example, this would occur if also ``g`` used ``call_cc``).

    Continuations are not accessible by name (their definitions are named by
    gensym). To get a reference to a continuation instance, stash the value
    of the ``cc`` argument somewhere while inside the ``call_cc``.

    The function ``func`` called by a ``call_cc[func(...)]`` is (almost) the
    only place where the ``cc`` argument is actually set. There it is the
    captured continuation. Roughly everywhere else, ``cc`` is just ``identity``.

    Tail calls are an exception to this rule; a tail call passes along the current
    value of ``cc``, unless overridden manually (by setting the ``cc=...`` kwarg
    in the tail call).

    When the pcc is set (not ``None``) at the site of the tail call, the
    machinery will create a composed continuation that runs the pcc first,
    and ``cc`` (whether current or manually overridden) after that. This
    composed continuation is then passed to the tail call as its ``cc``.

    **Tips**:

      - Once you have a captured continuation, one way to use it is to set
        ``cc=...`` manually in a tail call, as was mentioned. Example::

            def main():
                call_cc[myfunc()]  # call myfunc, capturing the current cont...
                ...                # ...which is the rest of "main"

            def myfunc(cc):
                ourcc = cc  # save the captured continuation (sent by call_cc[])
                def somefunc():
                    return dostuff(..., cc=ourcc)  # and use it here
                somestack.append(somefunc)

        In this example, when ``somefunc`` is eventually called, it will tail-call
        ``dostuff`` and then proceed with the continuation ``myfunc`` had
        at the time when that instance of the ``somefunc`` closure was created.
        (This pattern is essentially how to build the ``amb`` operator.)

      - Instead of setting ``cc``, you can also overwrite ``cc`` with a captured
        continuation inside a function body. That overrides the continuation
        for the rest of the dynamic extent of the function, not only for a
        particular tail call::

            def myfunc(cc):
                ourcc = cc
                def somefunc():
                    cc = ourcc
                    return dostuff(...)
                somestack.append(somefunc)

      - A captured continuation can also be called manually; it's just a callable.

        The assignment targets, at the ``call_cc[]`` use site that spawned this
        particular continuation, specify its call signature. All args are
        positional, except the implicit ``cc``, which is by-name-only.

      - Just like in Scheme/Racket's ``call/cc``, the values that get bound
        to the ``call_cc[]`` assignment targets on second and further calls
        (when the continuation runs) are the arguments given to the continuation
        when it is called (whether implicitly or manually).

      - Setting ``cc`` to ``unpythonic.fun.identity``, while inside a ``call_cc``,
        will short-circuit the rest of the computation. In such a case, the
        continuation will not be invoked automatically. A useful pattern for
        suspend/resume.

      - However, it is currently not possible to prevent the rest of the tail
        of a captured continuation (the pcc) from running, apart from manually
        setting ``_pcc`` to ``None`` before executing a ``return``. Note that
        doing that is not strictly speaking supported (and may be subject to
        change in a future version).

      - When ``call_cc[]`` appears inside a function definition:

          - It tail-calls ``func``, with its ``cc`` set to the captured
            continuation.

          - The return value of the function containing one or more ``call_cc[]``
            statements is the return value of the continuation.

      - When ``call_cc[]`` appears at the top level of ``with continuations``:

          - A normal call to ``func`` is made, with its ``cc`` set to the captured
            continuation.

          - In this case, if the continuation is called later, it always
            returns ``None``, because the use site of ``call_cc[]`` is not
            inside a function definition.

      - If you need to insert just a tail call (no further statements) before
        proceeding with the current continuation, no need for ``call_cc[]``;
        use ``return func(...)`` instead.

        The purpose of ``call_cc[func(...)]`` is to capture the current
        continuation (the remaining statements), and hand it to ``func``
        as a first-class value.

      - To combo with ``multilambda``, use this ordering::

            with multilambda, continuations:
                ...

      - Some very limited comboability with ``call_ec``. May be better to plan
        ahead, using ``call_cc[]`` at the appropriate outer level, and then
        short-circuit (when needed) by setting ``cc`` to ``identity``.
        This avoids the need to have both ``call_cc`` and ``call_ec`` at the
        same time.

      - ``unpythonic.ec.call_ec`` can be used normally **lexically before any**
        ``call_cc[]``, but (in a given function) after at least one ``call_cc[]``
        has run, the ``ec`` ceases to be valid. This is because our ``call_cc[]``
        actually splits the function into *before* and *after* parts, and
        **tail-calls** the *after* part.

        (Wrapping the ``def`` in another ``def``, and placing the ``call_ec``
        on the outer ``def``, does not help either, because even the outer
        function has exited by the time *the continuation* is later called
        the second and further times.)

        Usage of ``call_ec`` while inside a ``with continuations`` block is::

            with continuations:
                @call_ec
                def result(ec):
                    print("hi")
                    ec(42)
                    print("not reached")
                assert result == 42

                result = call_ec(lambda ec: do[print("hi"),
                                               ec(42),
                                               print("not reached")])

        Note the signature of ``result``. Essentially, ``ec`` is a function
        that raises an exception (to escape to a dynamically outer context),
        whereas the implicit ``cc`` is the closure-based continuation handled
        by the continuation machinery.

        See the ``tco`` macro for details on the ``call_ec`` combo.
