def prefix(tree, *, syntax, **kw):  # noqa: F811
    """[syntax, block] Write Python like Lisp: the first item is the operator.

    Example::

        with prefix:
            (print, "hello world")
            t1 = (q, 1, 2, (3, 4), 5)
            x = 42
            t2 = (q, 17, 23, x)
            (print, t1, t2)

    Lexically inside a ``with prefix``:

        - A bare ``q`` at the head of a tuple is the quote operator. It increases
          the quote level by one.

          It actually just tells the macro that this tuple (and everything in it,
          recursively) is not a function call.

          Variables can be used as usual, there is no need to unquote them.

        - A bare ``u`` at the head of a tuple is the unquote operator, which
          decreases the quote level by one. In other words, in::

              with prefix:
                  t = (q, 1, 2, (u, print, 3), (print, 4), 5)
                  (print, t)

          the third item will call ``print(3)`` and evaluate to its return value
          (in this case ``None``, since it's ``print``), whereas the fourth item
          is a tuple with the two items ``(<built-in function print>, 4)``.

        - Quote/unquote operators are parsed from the start of the tuple until
          no more remain. Then any remaining items are either returned quoted
          (if quote level > 0), or evaluated as a function call and replaced
          by the return value.

        - How to pass named args::

              from unpythonic import call

              with prefix:
                  (f, kw(myarg=3))  # ``kw(...)`` (syntax, not really a function!)
                  call(f, myarg=3)  # in a call(), kwargs are ok
                  f(myarg=3)        # or just use Python's usual function call syntax

          One ``kw`` operator may include any number of named args (and **only**
          named args). The tuple may have any number of ``kw`` operators.

          All named args are collected from ``kw`` operators in the tuple
          when writing the final function call. If the same kwarg has been
          specified by multiple ``kw`` operators, the rightmost definition wins.

          **Note**: Python itself prohibits having repeated named args in the **same**
          ``kw`` operator, because it uses the function call syntax. If you try to pass
          the same named arg multiple times, as of 0.15, you should get a
          `SyntaxError: keyword argument repeated` with a traceback.

          A ``kw(...)`` operator in a quoted tuple (i.e. a tuple that does not not
          represent a function call) is an error.

    Current limitations:

        - passing ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` not supported.

          Workarounds: ``call(...)``; Python's usual function call syntax.

        - For ``*args``, to keep it lispy, maybe you want ``unpythonic.fun.apply``;
          this allows syntax such as ``(apply, f, 1, 2, lst)``.

    **CAUTION**: This macro is experimental, not intended for production use.
