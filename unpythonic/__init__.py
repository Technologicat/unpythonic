"""Lispy missing batteries for Python.

We provide two submodules which implement the ``let`` construct:

    - ``unpythonic.let``:
        Pythonic syntax, but no guarantees on evaluation order of the bindings
        (until Python 3.6; see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0468/ ).
        Bindings are declared using kwargs.

    - ``unpythonic.lispylet``:
        Guaranteed left-to-right evaluation of bindings, but clunky syntax.
        Bindings are declared as ``(("name", value), ...)``.

With ``import unpythonic``, the default ``let`` construct is ``unpythonic.let``.
To override, just import the other one; they define the same names.

See ``dir(unpythonic)`` and submodule docstrings for more.
