    # This bug was REALLY hard to track down, so let's document:
    #  - In MacroPy, there's a thing called `macropy.core.macros.injected_vars`, which holds
    #    constructors for `self.file_vars` for an `ExpansionContext`.
    #  - Constructors are registered to it using the decorator `macropy.util.register(injected_vars)`.
    #  - Registrations occur in the order the constructor function definitions are encountered.
    #  - Some constructors may depend on having others available via the **kw mechanism (at least
    #    some of the **kws actually come from the `self.file_vars` of the expansion context).
    #  - Specifically, `interned_name` (from quick_lambda) requires `gen_sym` to have been defined first.
    #  - But if we import `quick_lambda` before other MacroPy modules, `interned_name` will get
    #    registered before `gen_sym`, raising a mysterious error:
    #        TypeError: interned_name() missing 1 required positional argument: 'gen_sym'
    #  - This occurs when MacroPy tries to instantiate `interned_name` for a `ModuleExpansionContext`.
    #  - That happens implicitly when we `import macropy.activate` (somewhere much later),
    #    because `activate` itself imports `failure`, which uses `hquotes`, which happens to use macros.
    #  - So to be safe, **always import macropy.activate first**, before other MacroPy modules.
    import macropy.activate  # noqa: F401, we only import it first so MacroPy boots up correctly.

def passthrough_lazy_args(f):
    """Mark a function for passthrough of lazy args.

    When a function has this mark, its arguments won't be forced by
    ``maybe_force_args``. This is the only effect the mark has.

    This is useful for decorating "infrastructure" functions that are strict
    (i.e. not lazy; defined outside any `with lazify` block), but do not need
    to access the values of all of their arguments. Usually the reason is that
    those arguments are just passed through for actual access elsewhere.

    If needed, it's still possible to force individual arguments inside the
    body of a function decorated with this, using `force` or `force1`.

    For example, `curry` uses this strategy to find out which function it
    should call (by forcing only its argument `f`), but it does not need to
    access the values of any of its other arguments. Those other arguments are
    just passed on to the function in question, so that's the correct place to
    make the lazy/strict distinction for those arguments. (`curry` then uses
    `maybe_force_args` to make the actual call, so that the call target is
    also checked for this mark.)

    **CAUTION**: The mark is implemented as an attribute on the function
    object. Hence, if the result is wrapped by another decorator, the mark
    won't be active on the final decorated function.

    The exact position where you want this in the decorator list depends
    on what exactly you're doing - the priority is set to `95` to make this
    apply before `curry`, so that `curry` will see the mark.

    **NOTE**: Conceptually, an argument having the passthrough-only property
    is closely related to parametric polymorphism. A function that just passes
    through an argument to another function, without accessing it, usually is
    parametric (in the polymorphism sense) in that argument. See the
    introduction of:

        Arjun Guha, Jacob Matthews, Robert Bruce Findler, Shriram Krishnamurthi 2007:
        Relationally-Parametric Polymorphic Contracts
            http://cs.brown.edu/~sk/Publications/Papers/Published/gmfk-rel-par-poly-cont/

    For simplicity, this decorator assumes blanket parametricity - i.e. the
    decorated function *could* be parametric in *all* of its arguments. however,
    it is not the role of this decorator to guarantee anything about parametricity.
    This is an implementation detail that says "treat this function as if it could
    be parametric in any or all of its arguments".

    It is then the responsibility of the decorated function to force those arguments
    it actually needs to access (i.e., not just pass through).
